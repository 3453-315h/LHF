[+]  Rockyou wordlist is decompressed!
[-]  Please enter the ip to scan (example 192.168.0.1)  : <target ip here>
```
##A "results" folder will be created after inputting the target ip. This folder can be found in the Recon directory. 

Example:
```bash
cd /opt/Recon/results
```

The results output includes nmap files...arachni files..nikto files..pretty much every fucking file from every scan the tools does can be found in this folder. 

##FYI, it will look like it's not doing anything but it actually is...I have nothing in place such as a status bar.
